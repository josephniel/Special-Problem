# Privacy-preserving Genomic Disease susceptibility Testing using Secure Multiparty Computation

This project is a PHP-based system that computes for the genomic risk coefficent of a patient that is used in disease susceptibility testing. Computation is kept private through the use of a multi-party environment using the Sharemind framework provided by Cybernetica.
